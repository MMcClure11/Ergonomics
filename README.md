### What is ergonomics?

- the process of designing or arranging workplaces, products and systems so that they fit the people who use them
- applies to the design of anything that involves people – workspaces, sports and leisure, health and safety
- aims to improve workspaces and environments to minimise risk of injury or harm

### Why does it matter?

- lower back pain is the world’s most common work-related disability – affecting employees from **offices**, building sites, and agriculture
- wrist and arm pain, eye strain are also common for computer users
- ie. *us digital nomads*

---
## Why does Meks care?

- I developed pain after 6 months of bad habits
	- rabbit hole of research

---
### What can you do?/What did Meks do?

- optimize your tools
	- laptop
	- mouse
	- keyboard
- eyes
- strength training
- be mindful

---
### Laptop placement

- elevate your laptop so top is at or slightly below eye level
	- for nomads, this can mean stacking boxes, books, whatever you have around, or buying an adjustable laptop stand
	- [Roost Laptop Stand](https://www.therooststand.com/)
- arms length distance
- adjust size of font so it is easy to read with no eyestrain

note:
help prevent curved shoulders & low back pain

---
## Laptop placement

- second screen height & distance apply
- the most used screen should be center to your body
- secondary screen great for things like
	- slack
	- notes
	- outlook
	- teams

---
## Laptop Tools

note:

some of these will be more or less helpful depending on your keyboard/mouse situation
some are mac specific, there are probably linux/windows compatible alternatives
if anything, this is just to give you an idea of what tools are available
most of these I learned about from co-workers when I saw their workflow and asked “wait... how did you do that?”

note:
it’s a journey and ever evolving

---
## Laptop Tools

- [nvim](https://neovim.io/)
	- fancy text editor that mostly developers use

note:
primary development tool

---
## Mouse

- vertical are recommended
- [Logitech Vertical Mouse](https://www.logitech.com/pt-br/products/mice/mx-vertical-ergonomic-mouse.910-005447.html)
	- highly recommended by a friend
- not for me, I haz tiny hands

note:
- but the trackpad is murder on my wrists
- rely on the afore mentioned tools and added mouse navigation to my keyboard

---
## Keyboard

- laptop keyboards aren’t ideal
- forces your hands together
- cannot have it at appropriate eye height and hand height
	-  elbows at about 90 degree angle or greater
	- wrists should relax down, not be stretched up
- keys are at a diagonal angle

---
## Ortholinear Keyboard

- your fingers like to move straight out and back in
- the diagonal keys mean they are stretching in weird ways
- ortholinear keyboards address this
	- the keys are stacked in a row

---
## Split Keyboard

- allows for chest and shoulders to be more open
- easier to maintain good posture
- frequent adjustments

---

## Key chording & Key placement

- awkward repeated movements and overreaching can lead to pain
- move common commands to stronger fingers
- set up shortcuts for those awkward combos

---
## But... keyboards are bulky?

- [Voyager](https://www.zsa.io/voyager/)
	- really nice GUI for customizing it
	- **$**
- [Ferris Sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep/)
	- steep learning curve for use, customizing, flashing the firmware, etc.
	- my favorite tool

note:
Yeah, I know. There are options! Necessary if you want to get the screen at the right height.

---
## Eyes

- protect from blue light (which can cause headaches (me!) and disrupt sleep (also me!))
	- [Gunnars](https://gunnar.com/)
	- screen protectors
	- check out settings: often a blue light filter option

---
## Eyes

- Make sure your font size is big enough
- “every 20 min, look at something 6 meters (20 feet) away for 20 seconds”
	- Just go do something else for a little bit when your eyes feel tired

---
## Strength Exercises

- being strong in your body is arguably the most important
- strength makes it easier to come back to good posture
- and that can serve as a reminder throughout the work day

---
## Strength Exercises - Posture

- wall arm lifts
	- start with 8 reps, work your way up to 15
	- up to 3 sets

---
## Strength Exercises - Posture

- bed/chair arm lifts
	-  8-15 reps
	- 3 sets
		- Fly
		- Rotator
		- Over head pull
	- add weights as you get stronger

---
## Strength Exercises - Posture

- rows
	- 8-15 reps
	- 3 sets
	- whatever weight/available heavy thing you have
	- tighten muscles to increase resistance

---
## Strength Exercises - Hands/Wrists

- rubber band extensions
- book lifts for fingers

---
## Sit or stand?

### Yes

note: 
it is actually unhealthy for humans to sit 8 hours AND stand 8 hours
research suggests that mixing both is ideal with breaks
I shoot for 3 hours standing per 5 hours sitting

---
## Be Mindful

- your body is intelligent, listen to it

---
## Be Mindful

- eyes tired? 
	- When was the last time you took a break?
	- Go stare at some trees in the distance

---
## Be Mindful

- back sore?
	- how is your posture?
	- do you need to adjust any of your physical tools?

---
## Be Mindful

- do your wrists hurt?
	- are you being lazy and not using the established tools?

---
## Be Mindful

- headache?
	- have you eaten?
	- how much water have you consumed?
	- is it from eye strain? are you blue light filters on?

---
## Be Mindful

- tired?
	- how has your sleep been?
	- do you need a nap?
	- do you need a creativity break?

---
## Be Mindful

- none of these are rules
- they are tools and I use them as needed

---
## Top Takeaways

- lots of tools at your disposal
	- physical: laptop, laptop stand, mouse, keyboard, glasses
	- software: tiling, app management, shortcuts
- take care of your body
- listen to your body
